## Project Overview
IRL has recreated SonicBloom festival in the metaverse featureing stages, music, and games! A great time capsule of this wonderful expierence where people from all around the world can come together in the metaverse and enjoy a great memory with their friends.

We used 3d tools like Blender, Cinema4d, and After Effects to create assets for this project and worked with a group of artists to bring it all together creating 3d assets for the project, bringing it to life.

The world lives inside Decentraland a blockchain based metaverse.

We recreated the virtual parcel using 3d tools like Blender, Cinema4d, and After Effects to make assets for this project. The world lives inside Decentraland a blockchain based metaverse. We worked with a group of artists from various disciplines bringing it to life using remote collaboration tools with over 100 artists featured in the exhibtions on site!
